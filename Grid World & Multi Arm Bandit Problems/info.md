## Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing various reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the GridWorld problem using the FrozenLake-v1 environment from OpenAI Gymnasium, and the Single-State Multi-Armed Bandit problem.

### GridWorld Problem

The FrozenLake-v1 environment represents the grid world where an agent needs to navigate from a starting point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles. The algorithms implemented for this problem include:

- **Value Iteration**
- **Policy Iteration**
- **Q-Learning**
- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**
- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Algorithm**
